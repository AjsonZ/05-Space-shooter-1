# 05-Space-shooter
Hello!

This is a space shooter in which the player must shoot and kill 5 enemy spaceships.  The objective of this exercise was to pull together all the lessons from class and turn them into a new game.  To guide myself through, I thought back to the bullets exercise that we did recently.

One thing I had trouble with was figuring out how to turn the background into a picture.  I saved a png of space to the assets folder, but could not figure out the command to make it the background.

Thank you for checking out my work!
